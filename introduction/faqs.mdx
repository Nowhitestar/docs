## When testnet? When mainnet? When token?

Soon! Be sure to follow us on [X](https://x.com/ChainbaseHQ) for latest updates.

## Is Chainbase open source?

Chainbase is in the process of open-sourcing all user-facing products and services; for the most up-to-date, you can take a look at our github repository here: https://github.com/chainbase-labs

## Will Chainbase work for smart contracts?

No! Chainbase does not execute contracts - it is specifically for making data accessible both on and off-chain. Rather than writing smart contracts, developers can execute sophisticated data processing using [manuscripts](https://chainbase.mintlify.app/core-concepts/manuscript#overview).

## Will I need to know Solidity to write manuscripts?

No! Most manuscripts are written in [SQL](https://chainbase.mintlify.app/core-concepts/manuscript#gpl). With [GPL](https://chainbase.mintlify.app/core-concepts/manuscript#gpl), you can write manuscripts in Typescript, Solidity, even Python.
