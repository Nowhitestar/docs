TheiaChat is an AI agent built by Chainabse Labs based on Theia, the first crypto world model. TheiaChat provides an interface through which non-expert users can interact with the Chainbase Network, opening up the ability to obtain on-chain data intelligence to everyone for the first time. 

Users can enhance the Chainabse Network when interacting with TheiaChat and benefit from it. This mainly involves two types of users:

1. **Non-Expert Users:** people without blockchain knowledge and skills, such as blockchain beginners. They can enhance the Chainbase Network by having conversations with TheiaChat and providing feedback on the results of the conversations, and the network rewards serious and honest users.
2. **Expert Users:** People with blockchain knowledge and skills, such as professional traders and security experts. They can enhance the Chainbase Network by building Theia Task Models in TheiaChat, and the network will reward Task Model builders with high adoption.

Chainbase Labs built the **Thea Security Model (TSM)** as an example to show the ability to build a Task Model based on the crypto world model Theia in TheiaChat. It is a security expert to offer advice in the crypto world, e.g., how to protect my wallet and money. It is constructed by training Theia with security books and community advices. 

## How do interactions with TheiaChat enhance the Chainbase Network?

Every user interaction with TheiaChat and every task model built are enhancements to the under hood chainbase network. The basic logic is that these actions will directly trigger **Change Data Captures (CDCs, aka Changlog)**, and these contents are permanently stored on Arweave. 

These are powerful complement to the Chainbase Network. It is also the first time that users can contribute data to enhance the Chainbase Network. Before this, only developers could enhance the network by building Manuscripts in the network. **This is the historical transformation of Chainbase Network from targeting 300,000 developers to targeting 30 million to 300 million users.**

In addition, every Changlog is a transaction on the Chainbase Network, which is permanently recorded on the Chainbase Network, and is public, censorship-resistant and cannot be manipulated. Its traceability guarantees the data income rights of every data producer.

### Enhance Chainbase Network by doing RLHF

Users can click on the right of TheiaChat after asking a question to make Theia smarter. The principle behind this behavior is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), which is a reinforcement learning technique designed to train models by combining human feedback to make their behavior more in line with human expectations.

The implementation of RLHF typically involves the following steps:

1. Pre-training model: First, the model is pre-trained on a large amount of pre-collected data. This step can use traditional supervised learning methods.

2. Human feedback collection: By having humans evaluate the model's output, collect human feedback on the model's behavior. This feedback is usually presented in the form of rewards (or punishments), indicating whether a certain behavior is good or bad.

3. Reinforcement learning training: Use the collected human feedback as a reward signal, further optimize the model's policy through reinforcement learning algorithms (such as policy gradient method). Specifically, after the model generates output, adjust the rewards based on human feedback to update the model's policy, making it more inclined to produce results that are popular with humans.

4. Iterative training: Repeat the process of collecting human feedback and reinforcement learning, gradually improving the model's performance.
