### Table Description
This dataset holds detailed logs emitted during transactions by smart contract events. These logs are pivotal for tracking activities such as token transfers, contract updates, and custom event notifications set by contract developers. For instance, when a user transfers ERC-20 tokens, the transaction log would capture the 'Transfer' event with details like the sender's address, recipient's address, and the amount transferred. This information is crucial for applications that need to monitor and respond to specific contract activities.
