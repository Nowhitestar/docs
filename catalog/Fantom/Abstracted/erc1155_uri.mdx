### Table Description
The ERC1155_URI event in the blockchain's ERC1155 standard is particularly significant for addressing how metadata is associated with the tokens managed under this standard. ERC1155, known for its efficiency in handling both fungible (like ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (like ERC721) within a single contract, also provides a flexible mechanism for linking token types to metadata.In ERC1155, the URI event (often referred to as ERC1155_URI) is emitted when the URI for a token type is set or changed. The URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier that points to a resource where metadata for the token can be found. This metadata typically includes information such as the token's name, description, image, and other attributes.
