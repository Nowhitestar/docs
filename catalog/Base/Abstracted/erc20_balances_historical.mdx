### Table Description
To view historical balances of ERC20 tokens for a specific Ethereum wallet, you would typically use blockchain explorers that support historical data queries. These platforms can track and display the balance of ERC20 tokens in a wallet at any given point in the past. This is possible due to the immutable nature of blockchain transactions. Each transaction is recorded and can be queried to reconstruct the balance of a wallet at a particular time. However, this process might require advanced tools or APIs provided by blockchain analytics platforms.
