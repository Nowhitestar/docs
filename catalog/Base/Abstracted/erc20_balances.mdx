### Table Description
ERC20 balances refer to the quantity of ERC20 tokens held in a particular Ethereum wallet. ERC20 is a standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a set of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow. To check the balance of ERC20 tokens in a wallet, you can use various blockchain explorers or wallet applications that connect to the Ethereum network. These tools allow you to enter a wallet address and view the balance of all ERC20 tokens that the wallet holds. The balance is typically displayed in the token's units and can be affected by transactions such as transfers and token swaps.
