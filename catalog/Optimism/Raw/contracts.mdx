### Table Description
The optimism.contracts table contains essential data about smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They are a fundamental aspect of Ethereum, enabling decentralized applications (DApps) and automating complex transactions without intermediaries. The optimism.contracts table includes several key components:
1. Contract Address: This is a unique identifier for each smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network. It is derived from the creator's address and the transaction nonce.

2. Creator Address: This is the Ethereum address of the account that deployed the smart contract. It provides traceability and accountability for the origin of the contract.

3. Creation Transaction: This includes the transaction hash of the deployment transaction, linking the contract to the specific transaction that created it.

4. Bytecode: This is the compiled code of the smart contract that gets executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It includes the contract's logic and functions.

5. ABI (Application Binary Interface): The ABI defines the contract's interface, including its functions, inputs, and outputs. It is crucial for interacting with the contract programmatically.

6. Source Code (optional): Some contracts include the original source code, providing transparency and enabling verification of the compiled bytecode.

7. Block Number: This indicates the block in which the smart contract was deployed, providing a chronological context for the contract's creation.

8. Timestamp: The exact time when the smart contract was deployed, allowing for time-based analysis and tracking.
