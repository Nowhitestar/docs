### Table Description
The ERC20_transfer event is a fundamental component of the ERC20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical to every other token of the same type, similar to traditional currencies. This standard is widely adopted for the creation of fungible digital assets on blast. In ERC20, the transfer function and the corresponding Transfer event are critical for moving tokens from one account to another. This is the primary mechanism through which token balances are adjusted within the network.
