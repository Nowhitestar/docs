### Table Description
The ERC1155_transfer_single event is part of the Ethereum blockchain's ERC1155 standard. This standard allows for the creation and management of both fungible (similar to ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (similar to ERC721) within a single smart contract. In contrast to the ERC1155_transfer_batch event, which facilitates the transfer of multiple token types in a single transaction, the ERC1155_transfer_single event is emitted for single-token transfers. This event is used when a user or a smart contract transfers a specific amount of a particular type of token to another address.
