### Table Description
NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger. Unlike fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, where each unit is identical and interchangeable, each NFT is distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another NFT. This uniqueness is what makes them valuable for representing ownership of specific digital or tokenized physical assets. NFTs are commonly used for digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, gaming items, and other digital goods that require proof of ownership and authenticity.
