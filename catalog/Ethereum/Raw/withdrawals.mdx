### Table Description
This table specifically documents withdrawal transactions from the network, focusing on the amount withdrawn, the source address, and the destination address. It's crucial for analyzing the flow of value out of Ethereum, such as Ether or token withdrawals to external wallets or exchanges. For example, when a user withdraws Ether from a DeFi platform to their personal wallet, the transaction would be recorded here, including details like the withdrawal amount and the receiving wallet address, offering insights into user behavior and liquidity movements.
