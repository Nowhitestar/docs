### Table Description
The dataset encompasses comprehensive details of all transactions on the network. It includes the initiating account, destination address, value transferred, gas used, and the data payload. For example, when a user sends Ether to another user, the transaction record would include the sender's and receiver's addresses, the amount of Ether sent, and the gas price paid for the transaction. Additionally, it also captures the nonce, which is the transaction count of the sender, helping in preventing double-spending and replay attacks.
