### Table Description
Stablecoin transfers refer to the movement of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset or a basket of assets. Stablecoins are commonly used in the cryptocurrency space for trading, remittances, and as a store of value due to their price stability. Stablecoin transfers can be tracked on the blockchain, providing transparency and auditability of transactions. These transfers can involve sending stablecoins between users, wallets, exchanges, or smart contracts, and the details of each transfer are recorded on the blockchain for verification and analysis.
