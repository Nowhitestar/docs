### Table Description
ERC1155_transfer_batch in blockchain data refers to a batch transfer operation using the ERC1155 standard on a blockchain network, particularly zksync. ERC1155 is a multi-token standard that allows for the creation and management of multiple types of tokens, including fungible (like ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (like ERC721), within a single contract.In the ERC1155 standard, the transferBatch function enables users to transfer multiple types of tokens to several recipients in a single transaction. This approach is efficient as it reduces the number of transactions that need to be sent, thus saving on transaction fees and reducing congestion on the blockchain.
